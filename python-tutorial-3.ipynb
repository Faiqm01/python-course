We're saying, \"_for_ each _a_ in this _b_, I want to do blank\". In Python we denote being in a loop, or in a conditional statement with indentations. So if you see code with a big space before it, its because its in a loop or a condition.\n",

This updates every loop, so for our case `a=[10, 2, 3, 5]`, `i` is first `10` then it becomes `2` then it becomes `3` then it becomes `5`. Sometimes people struggle to get their mind around this, but try thinking about it like we're saying \"I'm going to take go through this list `a` and I'm going to look at each piece of it individually.
